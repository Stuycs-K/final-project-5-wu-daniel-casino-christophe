# APCS2 Final Project

## Group Info
### Group Name: Proud Pac-Men
- Christophe Casino
- Daniel Wu
## Overview
We coded the timeless Pac-Man game in Processing, where we incorporated all the key elements from the game, such as the score counter, pellets/super pellets, movement of player and ghosts, etc… For our MVP, we created the basic Pac-Man game with no extra functions. For our map, we split the Processing screen into multiple subsections of squares to represent the tiles of the Pac-Man map. The map of Pac-Man is 28 x 31 tiles, and we adjusted the tile size and player size to match with the Processing screen. Player movement was implemented as usual: arrow presses signaling the movement direction and walls blocking the player from moving forward. We incorporated the specific movement patterns that the original ghosts had. Pellets and super pellets were also incorporated as normal, with their respective point values being added when they are collected.
